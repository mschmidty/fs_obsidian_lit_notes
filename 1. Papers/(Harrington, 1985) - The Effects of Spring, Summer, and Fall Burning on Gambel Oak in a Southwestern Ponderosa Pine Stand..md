## Notes

While interesting, this paper doesn't really test oak control over a long enough time frame.  The test window is only 4 years, testing a second treatment for only 2 years and the first burn for 4 years.  I'm also skeptical of the monitoring methods used.  Stems per sq ft. isn't a good metric comparing old oak with burned oak. It would be interesting to revisit these plots and see what they look like today.
