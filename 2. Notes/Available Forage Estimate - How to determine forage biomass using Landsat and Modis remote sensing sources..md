In Ortega et al. (2024) they used a method to assess how forage biomass for a mule deer migration study.  I'm very interested in this method because you could potentially use this same metric to measure available biomass for cows.  I'm also interested in this because you could probably validate the data with AIM data. 

The method uses the combination of NDVI derived from MODIS satellite images and Biomass data from the [Rangeland Analysis Platform](https://rangelands.app/products/#npp-data-download).    

I would very much like to understand how to use these biomass tools for information on livestock grazing. It is available from google earth engine.
